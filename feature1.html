			<p><i>by Charlotte Savidge</i></p>

			<h2 class='callout'>“A book is a container for information; an artist’s book is much more...”</h2>

			
			<p> Such a massive change brings with it far-reaching implications for how we conceptualize and make both digital and analog books, as well as how we preserve them and their content. Over the last few years, Pratt faculty, students, and alumni have been exploring our changing con- ception of the book in classes across the Institute on book production, preservation, and reading.
			</p>
			<h3>Beyond the Analog/Digital Divide</h3>
			<p>
			Adjunct Associate Professor of Digital Arts Linda Lauro-Lazin is questioning what constitutes the book itself. She teaches how the book can be both a digital and a physical object simultaneously in her combined graduate and undergraduate course “Artists’ Books in the Electronic Age.”
			</p>
			<p>
			Lauro-Lazin’s students create artists’ books that employ traditional book arts as well as digital components, practices, or inspi- rations. She teaches them to assume a digital mindset—a way to break beyond the confines of the physical object of the book and see how a book can occupy or exist in a variety of spaces. This crucial concept is often difficult for students to grasp, as many have grown up with an understanding of the book as old media.
			</p>

			<p>
			“The notion that we must choose between analog and digital is dangerous,” says Lauro-Lazin. “It creates a binary, when we really need to learn to fuse them together. That is how books will continue to thrive.”
			</p>
			<p>
			In Lauro-Lazin’s class, students are encouraged to bring together the digital and the analog for major assignments. Some choose to design and brainstorm online before creating the book by hand, while others integrate digital components by developing digital “pages” or “chapters” accessed through QR codes or links.
			</p>
			<h3>Rethinking Content</h3>
			<p>
			This mash-up of cutting-edge technique with age-old tradition gets at the heart of the struggle for book artists, writers, designers, and archivists. How can we understand how digital and analog books will coexist in the long-term? According to Lauro-Lazin, by making objects that draw from opposite ends of the spectrum, students begin to understand that different types of books live on in different ways.
			</p>
			<img src='images/robbin1.jpg' class='pic-hor'>
			<p>
			“While the book as a traditional form has a lasting presence, the technology that students integrate is so fleeting that the books they create may very well not be ‘readable’ in the near future,” Lauro-Lazin points out. “In general, thinking about permanence of material is important, especially when creating a book that spans different media.”
			</p>
			<p>
			The very idea that a book can span dif- ferent media has been slow to gain acceptance, as technology has often been viewed as being in opposition to analog books. This has drawn a line in the sand between traditionalists and early adop- ters of new reading platforms.
			</p>
			<p>
			In Pratt classrooms, students and faculty are contributing to the cultural shift in how we define written content and what can be contained within a book or text, a question that is at the heart of Assistant Professor Duncan Hamilton’s “Designing E-books” class in Undergraduate Com- munications Design. The class, which requires students to create a printed book, an enhanced e-book, and an interactive book app, emphasizes user experience and gives added value to the technological evolutions of the book. “In creating these forms, students are not just telling the story, but looking at the entirety of the ex- perience,” says Hamilton. “The books are no longer just words, but have meta- narratives and link to the wider data space.”
			</p>

			<p>
			In Hamilton’s view, the book itself can play a more active role in engaging the reader. Whereas in the past, narratives relied on writing alone, advances in e-books and interactive apps have allowed everything from charts to figures to become interac- tive features. “The e-book is a more fluid form, and it’s updatable,” clarifies Duncan. “In many ways, thanks to this technology, the book is now a living thing.”
			</p>
			<p>
			The organic nature of text and narrative is something that Assistant Professor of Humanities Mendi Obadike stresses in her undergraduate class “Poetry across Media.” Through writing and read- ing in nontraditional media, Obadike’s students turn the notion of poetry itself on its head. Obadike introduces her students to poetry in the form of dance performances, sculptures, and font samples. “It’s changing what it means to be literate,” she says. “There is a much greater use of images and sounds as a way of collecting and sharing ideas.”
			</p>
			<h3>Objects of Reference versus Reverence</h3>
			<p>
			The changing nature of writing and book production has brought with it sweeping implications for the collecting and sharing of ideas that Obadike mentions, as well as for the preservation of books. This is a challenge that faculty at Pratt’s School of Information and Library Science has worked enthusiastically to address in the classroom. Since the rise of digitization, the process of converting analog media to digital files, faculty and students have worked to find new ways to keep both digital and analog books alive. That entails staying informed about the latest strate- gies for publishing in the digital landscape, something School of Information and Library Science Dean Tula Giannini teaches in “E-publishing and Digital Scholarship,” a special summer course in London taught in collaboration with faculty at Kings College London. In a similar vein, Associate Professor of Information and Library Science Anthony Cocciolo teaches budding archivists to be strategic about digitiza- tion, encouraging students to understand the benefits, as well as the limitations, of using technology for preservation. In his “Projects in Digital Archives” class, stu- dents collaborate with a range of insti- tutions to digitize collections of analog materials that had previously been available to the general public in limited capacities.

			<p>
			While the delicate nature of rare books can restrict access, Cocciolo thinks that there can be drawbacks to mass digitization and the preservation of online texts. “People in the field are starting to realize that digital-born books are at greater risk than the rare books,” Cocciolo explains. “With the proper handling and storage conditions, books made of paper can last hundreds of years. However, few organizations have developed the capacity for long-term preservation of digital-born books.”
